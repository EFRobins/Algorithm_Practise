Algorithms and Data Structures Coding Practice - NeetCode 150 Programming List
Overview

Welcome to my Java coding practice journey! This README will guide you through how to effectively practice data structures and algorithms using the NeetCode 150 Programming List. The NeetCode 150 is a curated list of 150 programming problems that cover a wide range of topics, helping you improve your skills in data structures and algorithms.
Getting Started

    Fork the Repository: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will allow you to keep track of your progress and easily sync your code across different devices.

    Clone the Repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/EFRobins/algorithm_practise.git

    Set Up Your Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can use any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VSCode) or a simple text editor along with the command line.

Project Structure

The project structure is designed to help you organize your code efficiently. Each problem in the NeetCode 150 list will have its own folder under the src directory. For example:

css

neetcode-150-java
│
└── src
    ├── problem1
    │   └── Solution.java
    │
    ├── problem2
    │   └── Solution.java
    │
    └── ...

Coding Guidelines

    File Naming: Name your solution files as Solution.java.

    Documentation: Include comments or documentation within your code to explain the logic and approach you've taken. This will help you and others understand the code later.

    Testing: Write test cases to validate your solutions. Use a testing framework like JUnit if possible.

Coding Practice Strategy

    Understand the Problem: Before diving into the code, make sure you fully understand the problem statement. Identify the input, output, constraints, and examples.

    Plan the Solution: Spend some time planning and designing your solution. Break down the problem into smaller subproblems if necessary.

    Code Incrementally: Start by implementing small parts of your solution and test them individually. This incremental approach helps in catching errors early and ensures a smoother coding process.

    Optimize and Refactor: Once your initial solution is working, think about ways to optimize it. Consider edge cases and improve the time and space complexity if possible. Refactor your code for clarity and maintainability.

    Test Rigorously: Test your solution with various inputs, including edge cases and corner cases. Make sure your code handles all scenarios correctly.

    Review and Learn: After successfully solving a problem, review your solution. If you've taken inspiration from others, understand their approach and learn from it. Consider different ways to solve the same problem.
